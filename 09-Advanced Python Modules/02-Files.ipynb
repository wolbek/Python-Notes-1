    "**My notes**\\\n",
    "Opening a file using the 'with' statement in Python is considered better practice for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Automatic Resource Management: The with statement provides a built-in context manager, which takes care of the setup and teardown of resources. In the case of file I/O, it automatically opens and closes the file. This ensures that the file is properly closed after you're done with it, even if an exception is raised within the block. It helps prevent resource leaks and makes your code more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Simplified Code: Using the with statement simplifies your code. You don't need to explicitly open and close the file, reducing the boilerplate code. It also enhances code readability and makes the code more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Improved Error Handling: When you use with, you don't need to add explicit error-handling code to ensure that the file is closed properly. If an error occurs within the block, the context manager handles the cleanup, which is especially useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that the file is closed under all circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Scoped File Access: The with statement limits the scope of file access to the block, meaning you can't accidentally modify the file outside of the block. This can help prevent unintended changes to the file."

    "When you open a file using `f = open('test.txt')`, the file stays open until you specifically call `f.close()`.  Should an exception be raised while working with the file, it remains open. This can lead to vulnerabilities in your code, and inefficient use of resources.\n",
